    This software is a computer program whose purpose is to implement
    lightweight block ciphers with different optimizations for the x86
    platform. Three algorithms have been implemented: PRESENT, LED and 
    Piccolo. Three techniques have been explored: table based 
    implementations, vperm (for vector permutation) and bitslice 
    implementations. For more details, please refer to the SAC 2013
    paper:
    http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/445
    as well as the documentation of the project.
    Here is a big picture of how the code is divided:
      - src/common contains common headers, structures and functions.
      - src/table contains table based implementations, with the code 
        that generates the tables in src/table/gen_tables. The code here 
        is written in pure C so it should compile on any platform (x86  
        and other architectures), as well as any OS flavour (*nix, 
        Windows ...).
      - src/vperm contains vperm based implementations. They are written 
        in inline assembly for x86_64 and will only compile and work on 
        this platform. The code only compiles with gcc, but porting it to
        other assembly flavours should not be too complicated.
      - src/bitslice contains bitslice based implementations. They are 
        written in asm intrinsics. It should compile and run on i386 as 
        well as x86_64 platforms, and it should be portable to other OS 
        flavours since intrinsics are standard among many compilers.
    Note: vperm and bitslice implementations require a x86 CPU with at least 
    SSSE3 extensions.
